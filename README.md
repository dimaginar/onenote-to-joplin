# OneNote to Joplin Readiness

A Windows desktop tool that checks if your system is ready to migrate from Microsoft OneNote to [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/). It verifies installed software, COM automation, and OneNote sync settings — so you can identify and fix issues before starting a migration.

## ✅ What It Checks

| Check                     | What it verifies                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Joplin**                | Joplin desktop app is installed                                                          |
| **Windows OS**            | Windows 10 or 11, build version                                                          |
| **OneNote (Desktop)**     | OneNote desktop app is installed with working COM automation (not the Store/UWP version) |
| **Word**                  | Microsoft Word is installed with working COM automation (needed for export rendering)    |
| **OneNote Auto-Sync**     | Sync-on-close is enabled in OneNote settings                                             |
| **OneNote Full Download** | Notebooks are fully downloaded locally (not cloud-only stubs)                            |

Each check returns a clear status — pass, fail, warning, or skipped — with guided remediation steps for any issues found.

## 🔍 Transparency & Safety

This project was developed with the assistance of AI coding tools. The entire source code is public so you can review exactly what the application does.

- **Read-only**: The tool only reads registry keys and checks for installed software. It does not modify your system, OneNote data, or any files.
- **Verified code**: If you are tech-savvy, feel free to audit the Rust backend (`src-tauri/src/`) and the React frontend (`src/`).
- **Open Source**: Full transparency — the code speaks for itself.
